Within a year, Delhi government is targeting the induction of 35,000 electric vehicles (2/3/4 Wheelers and buses), 1000 EVs for last mile deliveries and 250 public charging/swapping stations to come up in Delhi.

In the next 5 years, the Delhi government is targeting to put 5 lakh new EVs in Delhi. Over the lifetime, these EVs are estimated to ```avoid ~Rs 6,000 crores in oil and liquid natural gas imports and 4.8 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions, which is equivalent to avoiding CO2 emissions from nearly 1 lakh petrol cars over their lifetime. They will also help avoid about 159 tonnes of PM 2.5 tailpipe emissions```.
